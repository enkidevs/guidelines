we get started, here's an example insight and here’s how it looks on Enki:What is an insight?InsightAn insight is a short and concise piece of knowledge containing raw learning material. These can vary in purpose and sometimes look, but generally an insight should:\nexpress meaningful (and interesting) information\nconvey information into a mobile-friendly structure\nnot contain false information\nnot be purely opinionated\n\nMultiple insights  are chained up and presented to a user in the form of a Workout.Insights are directly linked to other specific content-types:\nPractice Question (PQ)\nRevise Question (RQ)\n\nThis means each insight has its own PQ and RQ.  The main difference between them is that the PQ is shown directly within an insight, while the RQ is shown externally (before/without) seeing the insight.WorkoutA Workout is a bundle of ~5 insights and the \"unit of learning\" a user is meant to complete in a single session. From a user's perspective, they complete at least one workout per day.Workouts can be:\nNormal workouts (randomly generated) - 5 Insights of the same Level and Subtopic (a user opts-in for) For example 5 random beginner insights on Ecmascript 2015 (JavaScript) can make up such a workout\nCustom Workouts - the exact insights and their order can be “hardcoded” into a custom workoutThe purpose of these workouts is to provide a mean of structure and elaboration on a certain subtopic/subject of discussion.\nRevision Workouts - a workout generated based on a user’s seen insights (no new content is required), in which revise questions are asked before the posibility of reviewing the insightThe purpose of this workout is to ensure the user remembers the concepts learnt in a previous workoutPractice Question\n\nA Practice Question is a multiple-gaps exercise shown to users directly when reading the insight, at the bottom. Because it’s attached to the related insight, this question doesn’t have to be too general, but more specific with the information.Keep in mind that this is not a must as there are certain theoretical insights that won’t fit a good practice question.Revise QuestionA Revise Question is also a multiple-gaps exercise with the exact format as the PQ.These are shown in either Revision-Workouts or in Quick-Tests, their purpose being to test the user’s knowledge on specific insights/subject areas that he already went though.This question will be shown first without its related insights so the information on this should be a little bit more general and easier to remember than the Practice Question.What is an insight made out of?A single insight is made out of multiple fields.Some of these are mandatory (M), while other’s can sometimes be omitted.These are:Topic **[M]**The topic usually marks the language or framework an insight is referring to/written in.Currently our live topics are:\nGit\nCSS\nJavaScript\nJava\nPython\nLinux\n\nHowever, there are more topics that haven’t been published yet.In our GitHub editor, every directory in the first hierarchy level represents a separate topic. For a topic to be valid, within its directory there must be a README.md indicating the topic’s description.To specify the topic of an insight simply ensure the insight’s file is placed within the right topic directory.Subtopic **[M]**A subtopic represents a more specific area of content within which an insight can be placed.Every subtopic is in a child-parent relationship with a topic, this relationship being represented also through directory structure.Therefore, all subtopics of a topic are subdirectories within a topic directory.To have a valid subtopic you must also include a README.md file with the subtopic description inside its directory.For example under the JavaScript topic we can find various subtopics such as:\nEcmascript 2015\nCore\nPromises\nReact\nGulp\netc.\n\nSame goes to Java with:\nAnnotation\nGUI\nTesting\netc.\n\nTo specify the subtopic of an insight simply ensure the insight’s file is placed within the right subtopic directory.Title **[M]**The title should be able to express the main idea of the content.It must be between 4 and 120 characters long.Note: Keep in mind that the title of the insight is also shown with the RQ. That being said, you should take care when writing those such that the title doesn’t directly give away the answer.The title can use code blocks  inside it.The title is specified at the top of the insight file preceded with an # : # Custom `propType`'s to be required\nAuthor **[M]**This field should specify the username of the user creating the insight.The author is specified by the following line:author: catalin\nLevels **[M]**The levels mandatory field indicates the target audience of an insight, experience-wise.The levels currently available for an insight are:\nbeginner\nbasic\nmedium\nadvanced\n\nThis allows different recipes of level combinations such as:\nbeginner - fit for people with little to none knowledge on the subject\nmedium , advanced - fit for both confident and experts\nbeginner , basic , medium , advanced  - will be seen by all users, regardless of their level\n\nThe levels should be specified in the following format:levels:\n\n  - advanced\n\n  - medium\n\n  - basic\n\n  - beginner\nType **[M]**Because games are fundamentally insights as well, this field is used to differentiate the type of game.For insights, this field should be set to normal .For games check the game guideline:\nfill the gap\nbug splat\ntetris\n\nThis field should look like:type: normal\ninAlgoPoolYou can use the inAlgoPool boolean flag to state if an insight should be included in the random workout generations.Custom workouts can only be made up of insights with this field set to false.To use it simply append:inAlgoPool: false\nCategory **[M]**The category filed is also a mandatory field used to indicate the user the type of information he is presented with.The possible categories are:\nfundamental\nthe goal is to teach a core feature or fact of the topic or subtopic (e.g a core feature of JavaScript )\na feature or fact should only be considered fundamental if it's an important characteristic of the topic/language (in other words: it makes it special)\nbasic facts and features (expected and commonly found in other languages) should not be considered fundamental\n\n\nfeature\nthe goal is to teach that something exists (a function, a method, etc..)\nthe insight also need to explain briefly what it does\nthe user is trusted to guess/understand when and why to use it\nit must be non-trivial that this feature exists (some people may not suspect it does)\nthe title should be the name of the feature/function/method\n\n\ngood practice\nthe goal is to recommend the user to get into a good habit (of doing something in a particular way)\nthe insight should explain briefly why this is considered a \"good\" habit\nit should not be phrased as \"you should always do X\" (because there are always exceptions), but rather as \"you would usually want to do X by default\" (in a patronising way)\nreviewers should not be too picky if they don't agree 100% with the recommendation (these types of insights will always sound a bit subjective)\n\n\nhow to\nthe goal is to teach one possible way of doing something (typically by combining multiple functions and features)\nthe name of the insight should the name of what we want to teach to do (and NOT the name of the function or method used to do it)\nto be interesting, the insights must be teaching a particularly good way of doing something (either a short way, an efficient way, an elegant way, or an idiomatic way)\n\n\npattern / idioms\nthe goal is to teach a common pattern or common way of doing something\nto be interesting, the insight must explain briefly why this is commonly used\nthe difference between idiom s and how-to s is sometimes subtle, but the presentation is typically different because an idiom insight should directly present a \"pattern\" (for the people who recognise to skip the rest of the insight), rather than presenting first a goal and then a way of achieving it\nunlike how-to s, idioms are not necessary a \"good\" way of doing something, just a common way (worth learning because you will probably encounter it in existing code and will need to understand it)\n\n\ncaveats / gotchas\nthe goal is to warn users about common bugs and misconceptions\n\n\n\nThe category field should look like:category: good practice\nTagsThis field is used to add specific tags to insights for later querying and filteringex. For a python insight python 3.0 could be a representative tag ..Tags are specified by a simple list such as:tags:\n\n  - polyfill\n\n  - another-tag\nNotesThe notes field is the place where internal observations can be made on an insight.These are not shown to the userSimply add:notes: 'here is my note'\nParentThis is an optional field used to express weak parent-child relationships between insights.With it you can tell a parent insight such that the current insight won’t be shown to the user before he didn’t see the parent insight.To use this field simply set its value to the slug (short file title) of the parent insight.Keep in mind this won’t make chained insights go into the same workout. To achieve that please refer to Custom Workouts.Example parent usage:parent: session-handling-in-express\nLinksThe links fields is not a mandatory one, but it’s often used to link insight to external resources that can act as either further reading on the topic discussed or the source of the information.To attach links, the following format must be used:links:\n\n  - >-\n    [facebook.github.io](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/false-in-jsx.html){website}\n\n//  - >-\n//   [short-name](full-url){resource-type}\nContent **[M]**The content is the main part of the insight, here going most of the information.The content of an insight is the place to provide more detail, explanation and examples.Within the content one can use:\ncode blocks  - code snippets\nfootnotes\n\nThe maximum permitted column width of the content is 44 chars long. That means no words (or lines within code snippets) should exceed 44 chars.If a line of your code is beyond 44 characters, please add a line break at a readable point and continue on the next line with a two-space indent to indicate continuation. This ensures the insight will be readable on a mobile screen.The content of the insight is specified like:---\n## Content\n\nThe usage of the `false` keyword in **JSX** and implicitly **React** is worth mentioning because of its volatile behaviour.\n\nFirst of all, `false` is widely used to specify that a **React** element has no child:\n```\nReactDOM.render({false},\n                              myNode);\n```\nPractice QuestionEven though PQs are not mandatory, we want to keep a high rate of practical insights.That means most of the insight should have a PQ. (>70% of insights).Keep in mind, code snippets and code blocks can go inside the Practice question.For example:---\n## Practice\n\nYou can get *detailed* information about your Linux distribution by running:\n```\n$ ???\n```\n*`lsb_release -a`\n*`lsb_release -i`\n*`ls_release -a`\n*`lin_release`\nRevise QuestionRQ is also a non-compulsory field, however we want a RQ for every insight.The percentage of insights with RQ we aim for is 100-99% .This will guarantee the insight can also go into a Quick-Test or a Revision Workout.Keep in mind, code snippets and code blocks can go inside the Revision question.For example:---\n##Revision\n\nYou can get *detailed* information about your Linux distribution by running:\n```\n$ ???\n```\n*`lsb_release -a`\n*`lsb_release -i`\n*`ls_release -a`\n*`lin_release`\nFootnotesFootnotes are used to elaborate on some information that isn’t necessarily of interest to all users or necessarily relevant to the main topic of the insight.Within Footnotes you can also use both code blocks and code snippets .The Footnotes field looks like:---\n## Footnotes\n\n[1:LSB]\n**LSB** in the `lsb_release` command stands for *Linux Standard Base* which is a joint project by several Linux Distributions aiming to standardise the software system architecture.\nWhat should I keep in mind when writing an insight?\nGeneral Editorial Guidelines\nEditorial Guidelines for Linux Content\n\nHow do I write an insight?Insight CreationTo see the procedure of insight creation check this.Insight formatThe full markdown format of an insight should look like:# Insight Title\nauthor: authorName\n\nlevels:\n\n  - basic\n\ntype: normal\n\ninAlgoPool: false\n\ncategory: insightCategory\n\ntags:\n\n  - insightTag1\n\nnotes: 'a random note'\n\nparent: parent-insight-slug\n\nlinks:\n\n  - >-\n    [short-name](full-url){resource-type)\n\n---\n## Content\n\nInsight content goes here[1]\n---\n## Practice\n\nPractice question content goes heres\n---\n## Revision\n\nRevision question content goes heres\n---\n## Footnotes\n\n[1:Footnote Name]\nFootnotes content that will be linked with the word in content marked with [1].\nSpecific Insight SyntaxCode blocksText inside two ``` (back ticks) will be automatically converted into a code-block coloured by the topic colour:// TODO: add imageCode snippetsWrapping multi-line text with ````` (three back ticks) will convert it to a code snippet.

The line number specifies the number of the gap correctly fitting the answer.For example:The sky is ???.\nGrass is ???.\n\n *blue\n *green\n *red\n *yellow\n\n // blue will correctly fit the first gap\n // green will correctly fit the second gap\n// TODO: to add imagesFootnotes syntaxYou can add footnotes to words in your insight (content field) by specifying a number inside [] (square brackets) and in the Footnotes field (under Content) elaborating the footnote.---\n## Content\n\nInsight content goes here[1]\n---\n## Footnotes\n\n[1:Footnote Name]\nFootnotes content that will be linked with the word in content marked with [1].\nWithin footnotes, code blocks and code snippets can be used for illustration purposes."},"Games-guidelines.html":{"url":"Games-guidelines.html","title":"Games Guidelines","keywords":"","body":"Games guidelinesExampleHere are some examples for each type of game:\ntetris\nbugSpot\nfillTheGaps\n\nWhat is a game?An Enki game is a mobile-friendly,  interactive activity that puts the user’s knowledge to a test. It shouldn’t take more than a couple of minutes to finish, after which the user gets a score based on the number of correct answers.A game can be found under a Topic and a Subtopic, much like an Insight. Therefore, the activities should be restricted to that particular subtopic.A game should:\nincrease a user’s interest in the game’s topic/subtopic\ntest a user’s knowledge with regard to game level\nhave questions that could be explained in a small number of sentences\nbe fun\n\nNote that in order to reach a larger audience of users, a game level will most commonly be set to all [beginner, basic, medium, advanced]. In this case, one game may be seen as challenging by beginners and obvious by experts.In addition, game explanations are not currently implemented for all types of game. However, to prepare a game for the upcoming update it’s advised to have the explanations for each question noted somewhere (e.g. in Notes field).What is a game made out of?A game is a particular type of insight, written in the same way. Thus, most of the fields they share with insights. The ones that differ are listed below:Type [M]This field is used to differentiate the Games (and their type) from Insights. So far, there are 3 types of games:\nfill the gap\nbug spot\ntetris\n\nThis field should look like:type: fillTheGap\ntype: bugSpot\ntype: tetris\nWith any of these values, the parser is told to expect a Game Content field, which is quite explanatory. The syntax for each type of game will be explained in a bit.Content [M]This field has a different meaning for games than it has for insights. Here, it gives a brief explanation of the game content. Take, for example, the Be strict JavaScript/Core game:## Content\n\nDo you know what is allowed and not allowed in `strict mode`\nin JS? Can you spot the lines that would produce errors?\nGame Content [M]Every game type has a different format.Note that in this field you can make use of:\ncode blocks\ncode snippets\n\nGames are made out of a list of questions separated by ---, each one specific to the type:---\n## Game Content\n\nQuestion 1\n---\nQuestion 2\n---\n// etc.\nThe only game not abiding to this format is the tetris one.1. fillTheGapRight now, there are two ways of creating content for this gamea) Standard fillTheGap exercise working in the same way as Practice Questions. You can define multiple (or just one) missing gap(s) (marked by ??? ) a user has to fill. Answers are specified by * , first ones being the correct ones.Take the following snippet as example to one question format:    ???\n    x.equals('abc') // true\n    x.equalsIgnoreCase('ABC') //true\n\nString x = \"abc\";\nArrayList x = \"abc\";\nStringBuffer x = new StringBuffer(\"abc\");\n\n---\nb) Simplified multiple choice question. You can have a single question without any ??? gap, there being only one correct answer (first one specified by *).The syntax for multiple choice questions:    Which command can update a user's\n    authentication token?\n\npasswd\npassword\nauth-token\nps\n\n---\nIn both cases, the first * denotes the right answer and ---  means the end of the question. The question or snippet should be enclosed in code tags (three backticks ```).2. bugSpotThis game works by presenting the users a snippet of code for which they have to tap on the line of code that would produce an error or exception.To mark which line is wrong (the correct answer of the game), it must be followed by a commented line with the explanation.Here’s one of the questions of the Be Strict. game:---\n## Game Content\n\nfunction foo() {\n  \"use strict\";\n  eval(42);\n  // eval not allowed in strict\n}\nfoo();\n---\nDuring the game, each line of code is selectable. You point out the problematic line by adding a comment with an explanation of why the code isn’t working below it. Three dashes --- are used to separate questions. There’s no need for the separator after the last question.3. tetrisThis is a true/false type of game. It is named \"tetris\" because each wrong answer will be added to the tower of wrong answers, much like tetris blocks would stack.You must split the content of the game in two main categories (e.g. true or false / java8  or not java8).The syntax is the following:---\n## Game Content\n\nremote:local\n```false\ngit clone \ngit pull\ngit push\n```\n\n```true\ngit init\ngit commit\ngit add .\ngit rm README.md\n```\nThe first two fields, split by a : , represent the names of the this is false and this is true columns, respectively. When the users play the game, the would swipe either left if they think the answer is remote ( false with regard to being local), or right for a local command (true with regard to being local).The answers should be placed inside code snippets, specifying which set of options is false and which one is true."},"Editorial-Guidelines-for-Linux-Content.html":{"url":"Editorial-Guidelines-for-Linux-Content.html","title":"Linux content","keywords":"","body":"Editorial Guidelines for Linux ContentThese are a first pass at some basic editorial guidelines for Linux content based on what I saw after looking over all the Insights.Writing Useful ExamplesGood examples should be clear, runnable as written, realistic, and contain the fewest number of \"features\" necessary to illustrate the point. Everything in an example should be explained by surrounding text.An example that uses 4 command-line arguments and requires Debian to illustrate its point is strictly inferior to an example that illustrates the same point using 1 command-line argument and works on every Unix-like OS.Avoid distribution-specific commandsA small number of Insights are necessarily distribution-specific, e.g., an Insight describing a feature of apt-get. For the majority that aren't, avoid examples that instruct the user to use a distribution-specific command.Bad (assumes Debian)An example of && :$ apt-get update && apt-get install apache\nGood (assumes bash)An example of && :$ mkdir fancy_dir && cd fancy_dir\nAvoid distribution-specific directories and filesUnless an Insight is specifically about \"How to do X on Debian\" or \"How to do X on RedHat\", avoid directing users to specific directories or files that vary from distribution to distribution.If the Insight requires editing a file then give instructions in a distribution-agnostic way, possibly including one or two distribution-specific examples.Bad (assumes RedHat)Apache's main configuration file is called httpd.conf and can be located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.GoodApache's main configuration file is often called httpd.conf, apache.conf, apache2.conf, or similar. The name and location of this file vary from platform to platform and version to version. On recent Debian-based platforms it is located at /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and on recent RedHat-based platforms it is located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf. Note that these locations might be different on older versions of these platforms, too!Regardless of platform, you can find the location yourself with the httpd -V command. (Include generic instructions here.)Start with the simplest example possibleIf you want to explain what ls does then start with just ls as an example, not something like ls -lh. More \"interesting\" examples can come later.Note that this does not mean the first example should never include command-line arguments. For example, running ps alone is relatively rare compared to something like ps aux (and the output much less useful). Similarly, you'd never use a command like watch without some arguments.Ask yourself, \"Could I illustrate the same point with a simpler example?\" If the answer is \"yes\" take the time to refine it!Avoid superfluous command-line switches and argumentsAvoid using command-line switches and arguments that aren't essential to whatever point the example is meant to illustrate. Any time a user sees a command-line argument they aren't familiar with they'll ask \"What does -x10 do?\" and be left worried that they didn't fully understand the Insight. (-x10 is a hypothetical \"dummy\" command-line argument.)The easiest solution is to avoid using -x10 in the first place. If it can't be omitted or the example can't be reworked to avoid it then make sure to include an explanation of what -x10 does.Avoid OS-specific command-line switches and argumentsIdeally, every example would be runnable on any Unix-like OS, including Mac OS X. However, on Linux many core commands like ls, ps, man, etc. are provided by GNU Coreutils and have GNU-only command-line switches and arguments which differ from their BSD counterparts.Bad (uses Linux-only argument)$ apropos -s8 \"user*\"\nGood$ apropos \"user*\"\nThe -s switch is GNU-specific, so unless the -s8 switch is essential to the example, it can be safely omitted. Not only does this make the example more portable but it makes for one fewer thing to explain (i.e., what -s8 does).Key InformationExplain the command-line switches and arguments used in each exampleIf you use a command-line switch or argument in an example then make sure to explain it with supporting text. A user should never have to ask \"What does -x10 do?\""},"GLOSSARY.html":{"url":"GLOSSARY.html","keywords":"","body":""}}}
